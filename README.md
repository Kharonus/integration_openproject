#### Background jobs

To be able to periodically check activity in OpenProject (when "notifications for activity in my work packages" is enabled), you need to choose the "Cron" background job method and set a system cron task calling cron.php as explained in the [documentation](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_server/background_jobs_configuration.html#cron).
